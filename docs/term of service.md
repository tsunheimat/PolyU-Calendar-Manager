**Calendar Subscription Links:**
The Service allows you to publish your schedule to a URL (e.g., `webcal://`) to sync with apps like Google Calendar or Outlook.

* **Privacy Warning:** These subscription links are generated to be unique to you, but they are accessible to anyone who possesses the link.
* **Responsibility:** You are solely responsible for keeping your subscription link private and for whom you share it with.

## 4. Data Privacy and Storage

* **Data Storage:** Your data (events, calendar files, and account info) is stored using **Supabase**, a third-party backend-as-a-service provider. By using this Service, you acknowledge that your data is processed subject to Supabase's infrastructure and security standards.

## 5. Intellectual Property

* **Our Rights:** The source code, design, and functionality of the App (excluding third-party libraries) are the property of the Service operators.
* **Your Data:** You retain all rights to the calendar data and ICS files you upload. You grant us a license to host and process this data solely for the purpose of providing the Service (e.g., generating the subscription URL).

## 6. Disclaimers (No Warranty)

**The Service is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis.**

* **Schedule Accuracy:** We do not guarantee the accuracy of the parsing logic used to import your university timetable. It is your responsibility to verify that the dates, times, and locations in the App match your official university schedule.
